# SyncMPV
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leviat/SyncMPV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leviat/SyncMPV)

SyncMPV is based on the mpv media player and aims at synchronizing the status of several players across computers in a host-client way. People can now comfortably get together in Skype and watch films together without being spoiled by the reaction of their friends. One must either provide a valid stream URL or a local media file. The host will not stream any content over the web at all.
